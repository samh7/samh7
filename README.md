## About Me

I'm a software engineer focused on backend development with a strong foundation in building **scalable APIs**, **real-time systems**, and **fault-tolerant applications**. I specialize in modern frameworks like NestJS, Phoenix, and React, with deep expertise in functional programming and AI/LLM integration. I leverage LangChain, RAG, and vector databases to deliver intelligent solutions that meet complex business requirements.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Experience

<details>
<summary><strong>Phoenix/Elixir Backend Patterns</strong></summary>

- Actor model concurrency with GenServers and Supervisors for fault tolerance
- Phoenix Channels for real-time WebSocket connections at scale
- Ecto schemas with changesets for data validation and database interactions
- OTP applications with supervision trees for self-healing systems
- Pattern matching and functional programming principles for robust code

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>NestJS Backend Patterns</strong></summary>

- Dependency injection and modular architecture with feature modules
- Repository pattern implementation with TypeORM
- Custom decorators, guards, and interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- Middleware chains with CORS, Helmet security, and rate limiting

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>React Frontend Architecture</strong></summary>

- Component composition and custom hooks for state management
- Context API for global state and HOCs for reusability
- Compound component patterns and render props for complex UI
- React Query for server state and optimistic updates

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Database & API Design</strong></summary>

- Normalized PostgreSQL schemas with indexing and migrations
- RESTful APIs, GraphQL resolvers with DataLoader optimization
- Phoenix Channels and WebSocket gateways for real-time features
- Redis caching and session management

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Message Queue Integration</strong></summary>

- RabbitMQ work queues, pub/sub patterns, and dead letter queues
- Event-driven architecture for decoupled communication
- Saga pattern for distributed transaction management
- Elixir's built-in message passing for lightweight process communication

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Microservices & DevOps</strong></summary>

- Containerized services with Docker and health checks
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Structured logging with correlation IDs and observability
